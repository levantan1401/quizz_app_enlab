### Here are the user stories of the Quiz application:
1. Users can start the quiz by pressing the "Start" button on the main screen
2. Users should be presented with a question and four possible answers on the screen
3. After selecting an answer, the app should validate the selection and provide feedback to
the user, indicating if the chosen answer is correct or incorrect.
4. The app should then display the next question, repeating this process until all the
questions in the quiz have been answered.
5. At the end of the quiz, the app should present the user with the following statistics:
a. The total time the user takes to complete the quiz is displayed in a user-friendly
format.
b. The number of correct answers the user provided during the quiz.
c. A clear message indicating if the user passed or failed the quiz, based on
predefined passing criteria.

6. The app should provide an option for users to review their answers after completing the
quiz, allowing them to see the correct answers for the questions they answered
incorrectly.
7. Users should have the ability to replay the quiz or exit the app once the quiz is
completed.
## Requirements:
1. Analyze the user stories above and submit the user flow diagram. You can use any
online drawing tool like Draw.io.
2. Analyze the database and submit the E-R diagram.
3. Submit your source code implementation (UI, API integration) of at least the features
listed below:
a. Screen for getting a list of questions from this API and showing on a screen for
the user to answer
b. Validate the userâ€™s answer and show feedback
c. Screen for Quiz results (passed or failed) with the detail of time, correct and
